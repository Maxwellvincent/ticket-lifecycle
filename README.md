<h3>Working the Issue</h3>

Agents analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve assigned tickets. Escalation rules determine who can modify high-priority tickets. Some tickets may be inaccessible until granted appropriate permissions in the Admin Panel, demonstrating restricted access controls.

<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>
Once the issue is resolved, agents update the ticket status and document the final resolution steps. Best practice dictates that every completed task should be ticketed, reinforcing the importance of structured workflows and IT metrics.
